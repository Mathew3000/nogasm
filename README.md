# Warning
The pcb is not fully tested yet. Might not work as expected.

# Mods
24 LEDs on pc edge <br/>
ESP32 instead of a teensy/teensyduino<br/>
Includes KiCad files<br/>

### Case
The case can be 3D printed without support material. Print at least the top half of the case in white to see the LED display beneath. 
Files will be uploaded once tested.

### PCB
All the Gerber files are included to order a set of PCBs. The PCB has mostly surface-mount components, and is doable with either a soldering iron or solder paste.
The components have been chosen so they can be assembled by the JLCpcb Assembly service. The only part that needs to be sourced from elsewhere and handsoldered is the pressure gauge.

### Vibrator
The vibrator is made from a Mabuchi RS-555PH motor, with an eccentric mass pressed onto the shaft. These can be purchased pre-assembled, or built from the motor and some .88" to 1" diameter cylindrical brass stock.
The vibrator case is compatible with attachments designed for the Hitachi Magic Wand. The motor is press-fit or glued into the two halves of the case.
